# riscv_fpga
An implementation of the basic RISC V architecture, specialized for Xilinx FPGAs. In the future we plan to extend it and go for a ASIC implementation. We are doing this as the final year project in Electronics and Telecommunications Department, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. Wish us luck!!!
